# Weather-Wall-Frame

Weather Wall Frame is designed to convey concise information about weather outside the userâ€™s residence. It consists of two modules which work with each other in order to create a glanceable display and convey information about the climate that is specific to his residence.



Step 1: DataGetter
DataGetter

Description:

The DataGetter module is placed just outside the house within the range of an internet WIFI connection to sense data such as humidity, temperature, light intensity, heat index and dew point using sensors. This information is then uploaded into a cloud to be used by the display module.

Components:
DHT22
light sensor
Photon
Jumper Wires
Bread Board
4.7k Ohm Register
10k Ohm register

Circuit:
Refer the image above for circuit board connections.

File:
WeatherDataGetter.ino
Compile and flash the above file using web IDE called https://build.particle.io or flash the WeatherDataGetter.bin on the photon



Step 2: Display
Display

Description:

The Display module is a wall Frame programmed to access the weather data on the cloud and display it on the wall frame. It gives subtle hints about the climate outside so that the user might take necessary precautions while going outdoors.

Components:
LED's (Green-1, Blue-1, RED-1, White-1, Yellow-2)

Servo Motor

Photon

Jumper Wires

Bread Board

Circuit:
Refer the image above for circuit board connections.

File:
WeatherAmbientDisplay.ino
Compile and flash the above file using web IDE called https://build.particle.io or flash the WeatherAmbientDisplay.bin on the photon



Files Required

The above INO files contain the codes for the photons which need to be compiled before flashing, whereas the BIN files are the per-compiled and could be directly flashed on the photons.
